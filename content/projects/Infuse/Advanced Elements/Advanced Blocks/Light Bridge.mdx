title: Light Bridge
description: Basic item transportation
---

Once placed down and powered by an energy beam, it will fire a transportation beam. Items placed on top off that beam will be moved by the beam. Items on that beam will not be affected by gracity. If the beam (and items) encounter a chest directly in it's path, the item will directly be deposited in it. The speed at which the items move are dependent on the power of the beam used to supply energy to the light bridge.
