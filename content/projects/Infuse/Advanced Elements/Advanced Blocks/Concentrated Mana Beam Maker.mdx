title: Concentrated Energy Beam Maker
description: Damaging energy beam maker

This is the only block (For now) that is able to interact with the world. When powered, it will fire a concentrated beam of energy that breaks blocks and deal damage to entities relative to it's power. Distance changes resistance like any other beam. Type changer and transmitters do not work on beams fired by this block.
