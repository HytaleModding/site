title: Energy Scatterer
description: Energy beam duplication tool

The goal of using an energy-scatterer is to raise th eamount of beams comming from a single point. When a beam enters an e-scatterer, it fires a beam in every free horizontal (x and z axis) face it can. Each resulting beam will have 0.5 less power then the original.

The vertical e-scatterer hase the same use as the regular e-scatterer, but it fires beam verticaly (y and z axis) instead.
