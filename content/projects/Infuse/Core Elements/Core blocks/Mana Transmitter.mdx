The Energy-Transmitter is Infuse's repeator. Without upgrades, the block acts like air and doesn't use resistance to let the beam pass through.
There are two possible upgrades : 
- Scope : Extends the range (resistance) of mana passing through
- Delayer : Adds a delay between receiving energy and letting out said energy.

Both options can be added simultaneously. The each have an upgrade letting the player decide how much power/delay they want to add.
