## Why learn to code? We have visual scripting!

Yes we do, and honestly you should try that out. Visual scripting is a great addition to Hytale and 
we know it'll be powerful, but nothing beats the ability of being able to read and write Java code, 
with the ability to build even more powerful mods and plugins.

## Should everyone trying to mod Hytale learn how to code?

No one should feel like they HAVE to learn to code to make stuff in Hytale. Simon and his team have 
validated this time and time again with their strives in graph editors and visual scripting. You can 
change mob behavior, world generation, etc. all with just these tools.

But if you're looking to build more complex things that could be used by large scale server networks 
and big names, you'll want to learn how to code. And that's where this guide comes in...

## Okay, I'm interested. What's to come?

Over the course of these next several lessons you'll learn the basics of coding, whether it be in 
Python or jumping straight into Java, plus how to setup your environment for building mods and what 
resources to look to for extending your knowledge. 

The guides' themselves will be take a very big "birds eye view" approach to things and provide links 
to resources to do the actual coding. This is done because, quite frankly, enough resources exist on 
how to learn this stuff, it's just the act of finding the right stuff on Google that can be hard. 
Learning to be able to code without guidance is the goal. The Hytale Modding community is always there 
to help you troubleshoot issues and give feedback, but to become a truly well rounded developer, you'll 
have to pick up a lot of this stuff just by reading from resources. 

Remember, learning to code is *hard*. You will trip and fall, but you will be able to get back up. Stay 
resilient, believe you can make cool stuff, and I promise you success will come.
