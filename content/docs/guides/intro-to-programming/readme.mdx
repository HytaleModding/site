description: An introduction that introduces the Introduction to Programming course.

This guide was written by [Grayvox](https://grayvox.com), for the benefit of the Hytale Modding 
community. 

Many people who wish to mod Hytale may have little to no programming experience prior,
and this guide is meant to serve as a fix for that. It's minimal and to the point, so if you prefer
a more interactive or gradual introduction to programming, this *may* not be for you. Otherwise, 
give it a shot. 

Remember, programming is a long journey, and technology is constantly evolving. Get ready to be 
stumped, get annoyed at your editor, and scower every inch of Google to find an answer to an 
obscure error you got. Good luck!
