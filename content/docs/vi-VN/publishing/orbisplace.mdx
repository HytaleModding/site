  Choose whether the resource belongs to your personal account or one of your Teams.

- **Resource Name**  
  Pick a clear and descriptive name that users can easily recognize.

  This unique identifier is used in your resource URL  
  (for example: `orbis.place/mod/my-awesome-mod`).

- **Tagline**  
  A short, catchy description (up to 200 characters) displayed on resource cards.

- **Type**  
  Select the category that best fits your content:
  - **Mod**
