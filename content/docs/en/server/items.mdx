This page contains a list of all **Items** available to be used as a key in the **AssetMap**.

## What counts as an “Item”

An item is any `.json` file under the configured **Item root** (typically `Assets/Server/Item/`) that:

- Parses as valid JSON
- Is a JSON **object** (dictionary)
- Has an item id in one of these fields (first match wins):
- `Id`, `ItemId`, `itemId`, or `id`

If an item has `TranslationProperties.Name`, that value is treated as the translation key. Display names are resolved from translations when possible; otherwise they fall back to the translation key or a humanized item id.

## Classification and gameplay-safe filtering

Each file is classified by relative path:

- `debug`, `template`, `editor`, `prototype`, `hypixel`, `qa`
- `gameplay-safe` is `true` only if none of the above apply
- `block-migration` is set only for `Block/Migrations/`
