Creating a command is easy. You need to extend the `CommandBase` class.


## Simple Event


```java
public class ExampleEvent {

  public static void onPlayerReady(PlayerReadyEvent event) {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    player.sendMessage(Message.raw("Welcome " + player.getDisplayName()));
  }

}
```

## Registering the event

To register the event, you need to register it via the EventRegistry in your plugin's main class by providing the event class and the handler:

```java
public class MyPlugin extends JavaPlugin {

    @Override
    public void setup() {
        this.getEventRegistry().registerGlobal(PlayerReadyEvent.class, ExampleEvent::onPlayerReady);
    }
}
```
