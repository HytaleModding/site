This guide will walk you through setting up a complete development environment for Hytale modding, including all necessary tools and dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:
- A computer running Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
- At least 8GB of RAM
- 10GB of free disk space
- Administrative privileges on your system

## Required Software

### 1. Java Development Kit (JDK)

Hytale modding requires Java 25 or later. We recommend using OpenJDK.

#### Windows
1. Download OpenJDK 25 from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/)
2. Run the installer with default settings
3. Verify installation by opening Command Prompt and running:
```bash
java -version
```

#### macOS
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install openjdk@25
```

<Callout type="info">
If `java --version` shows "Unable to locate a Java Runtime", add OpenJDK to your PATH:
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$(brew --prefix)/opt/openjdk@25/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```
</Callout>

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-25-jdk
```

### 2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

We recommend IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition for Hytale modding.

1. Download from [JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
2. Install with default settings
3. Launch and complete the initial setup wizard

### 3. Java Build Tool (Optional)
We recommend using a Gradle Wrapper for managing dependencies and building your Hytale plugins. It provides benefits by eliminating the need for a system-wide Gradle installation and ensuring consistent Gradle versions across different environments. (Alternatively you can use Maven, but this guide focuses on Gradle since it is the default for our plugin template.)

The plugin template in the following sections includes a Gradle Wrapper, so you can skip this step if you plan to use the template. However, if you wish to install Gradle globally, follow these steps:

1. Visit the official website: https://gradle.org/releases/
2. Download the newest gradle binary: `gradle-9.3.1-bin.zip` (Binary zip archive)
3. Unzip it
4. Add the `gradle-9.3.1/bin/` folder to your PATH

You can now try the command `gradle -version` to verify Gradle is installed correctly. Make sure to do this in a fresh new terminal instead of one you had opened from before!

## Setting Up Your Workspace

### 1. Clone the Plugin Template

Instead of creating an empty directory, we'll use the official Hytale plugin template:

```bash
# Clone the template repository
git clone https://github.com/HytaleModding/plugin-template.git MyFirstMod
cd MyFirstMod
```

If you don't have Git installed, you can download the ZIP file from the repository page and extract it to a folder named `MyFirstMod`.

### 2. Open Plugin in your IDEA

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA
2. Click "Open" and navigate to your `MyFirstMod` directory
3. IntelliJ will automatically detect it as a Gradle project
4. Wait for the project to index and dependencies to download

    We recommened following [this](https://gist.github.com/TheNullicorn/90a619796c40f20ae1fcf13094c1a57d) guide to ensure you are using the correct `Nonnull` in your projects.
</Callout>

## Alternate Approach: Hytale Dependency
If you prefer to set up your project from scratch without using the template and importing the hytale dependencies manually, follow these steps:
```gradle
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven {
        name = "hytale-release" // Or "hytale-pre-release" for pre-release versions
        url = uri("https://maven.hytale.com/release") // Or "https://maven.hytale.com/pre-release"
    }
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly("com.hypixel.hytale:Server:<latest-version>") // Replace <latest-version> with the latest version number
}
```

Or for Maven:
```xml
<project>
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>hytale-release</id> <!-- Or "hytale-pre-release" for pre-release versions -->
            <url>https://maven.hytale.com/release</url> <!-- Or "https://maven.hytale.com/pre-release" -->
        </repository>
    </repositories>

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.hypixel.hytale</groupId>
            <artifactId>Server</artifactId>
            <!-- Replace with latest version, Hytale provides jars for the last five releases -->
            <version>LATEST_VERSION_HERE</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</project>
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have your development environment set up with the plugin template:

1. **Customize the template** - Edit the `settings.gradle.kts`, `build.gradle.kts` and `manifest.json` file to change your mod's name and details
2. **Explore the code structure** - Familiarize yourself with the template's organization
3. **Start modding** - Begin writing your first Hytale plugin!
