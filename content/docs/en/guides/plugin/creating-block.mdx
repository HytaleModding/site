To create a new object you need to:

- Set *IncludesAssetPack* to true in manifest.json

- Then in your mod resource folder you will need a structure like that:
```
    resources
    |-Server
    | |-Item
    | | |-Items
    | |-Languages
    |   |-en-US
    |-Common
      |-Blocks
      |-BlockTextures
```

In Server/Languages/en-US we will add a items.lang

```
    my_new_block.name = My New Block
    my_new_block.description = My Description
```

## Simple Block

In Server/Item/Items we will create a my_new_object.json

```json
    {
        "TranslationProperties":{
            "Name": "items.my_new_object.name",
            "Description": "items.my_new_object.description"
        },
        "Id": "MyNewBlock",
        "MaxStack": 20,
        "BlockType": {
            "Material": "Solid",
            "DrawType": "Cube",
            "Opacity": "Transparent",
            "Textures": [
                {
                    "All": "BlockTextures/texture.png",
                    "Weight": 1
                }
            ]
        },
        "Icon": "Icons/ItemsGenerated/my_new_object.png"
    }
```

Now, you just need to place your texture in Common/BlockTextures and your icon in Common/Icons/ItemsGenerated

## Custom Model

In Server/Item/Items we will create a my_new_object.json

```json
    {
        "TranslationProperties":{
            "Name": "items.my_new_object.name",
            "Description": "items.my_new_object.description"
        },
        "Id": "MyNewBlock",
        "MaxStack": 20,
        "BlockType": {
            "Material": "Solid",
            "DrawType": "Model",
            "Opacity": "Transparent",
            "CustomModel": "Blocks/my_new_model.blockymodel",
            "CustomModelTexture": [
                {
                    "Texture": "Blocks/texture.png",
                    "Weight": 1
                }
            ],
        },
        "Icon": "Icons/ItemsGenerated/my_new_object.png"
    }
```

Now, you just need to place your texture and model in Common/Blocks and your icon in Common/Icons/ItemsGenerated
