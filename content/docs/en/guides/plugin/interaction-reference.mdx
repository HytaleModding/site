### SimpleInteraction 

Most interaction types below are inherited from SimpleInteraction and have these
 fields.  If a type does not have these fields, the documentation will mention it.

The purpose of SimpleInteraction is to facilitate Interaction chaining by taking different paths
 based on whether the Interaction succeeded or failed.  The circumstances under which
 a given Interaction fails are generally type-specific (and described in the documentation
 below), but all interactions will be marked failed if they are cancelled via one of the
 many, many mechanisms for doing so.

It is valid to create an interaction asset of type "Simple", which can be valuable when you want to use the 
  interaction fields with no additional functionality.

**SimpleInteraction Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Next | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `Interaction`) | **No** | After this Interaction has finished, "Next" will be executed if this Interaction did not fail. |
| Failed | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `Interaction`) | **No** | After this Interaction has finished, "Failed" will be executed if this Interaction failed. |


## Flow Control

These are interaction types used to control the flow of an interaction chain and allow interactions
 to be composed into more complex behaviors.  These interaction types generally do not pertain to 
 the game and instead pertain to the interaction system itself.


### Condition 

This interaction will fail if one of the fields is provided but does not match the current state.

**Condition Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| RequiredGameMode | `GameMode` | **No** | If provided, the interaction will fail if the current GameMode does not match the provided value. |
| Jumping | `Boolean` | **No** | If provided, the interaction will fail if the player's Jumping state does not match the provided value. (i.e. if True, the player must be jumping, if False, the player must not be) |
| Swimming | `Boolean` | **No** | If provided, the interaction will fail if the player's Swimming state does not match the provided value. (i.e. if True, the player must be swimming, if False, the player must not be) |
| Crouching | `Boolean` | **No** | If provided, the interaction will fail if the player's Crouching state does not match the provided value. (i.e. if True, the player must be crouching, if False, the player must not be) |
| Running | `Boolean` | **No** | If provided, the interaction will fail if the player's Running state does not match the provided value. (i.e. if True, the player must be running, if False, the player must not be) |
| Flying | `Boolean` | **No** | If provided, the interaction will fail if the player's Flying state does not match the provided value. (i.e. if True, the player must be flying, if False, the player must not be) |

**GameMode Values**
- `Creative`: The game is currently in Creative Mode 
- `Adventure`: The game is currently in Adventure Mode 


### FirstClick

This interaction does not inherit from SimpleInteraction and therefore has no Next or Failed fields. 

This interaction has two fields that each contain a reference to an Interaction: Click and Hold.  If the root interaction 
 of the chain was initiated by a client button/key press (or simulated NPC input) and the input was a tap, then 
 the Click interaction is run. if it was a longer press, then the Hold interaction is run.

As a minor implementation detail, this interaction is internally marked as failed when the Hold path is followed. 
 This generally shouldn't matter.  If the interaction was not initiated by a key press at all, the Click path will be followed,
 but it seems risky to rely on that behavior.

**FirstClick Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Click | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `Interaction`) | **No** | If provided and the root interaction of the chain was initiated by button/key press, this interaction is executed next if the press was a quick tap. |
| Hold | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `Interaction`) | **No** | If provided and the root interaction of the chain was initiated by a button/key press, this interaction is executed next if the press was a longer hold. |


### Interrupt 

This interaction can be used to cancel one or more running interaction chains on an entity and **all forked interaction 
  chains those chains have spawned that are still currently running**.  All interaction chains canceled in this manner will be marked as 
  Failed, which may have additional implications if the canceled chains are themselves forked from 
  other chains that are still running.

**Interrupt Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Entity | `InteractionTarget`<br />(Default: User) | **Yes** | The entity that is the owner of the target interaction chains.  This field can indicate the Owner, User, or Target of this interaction chain. |
| InterruptTypes | `Array`<br />(Element Type: `InteractionType`) | **No** | A set of InteractionTypes that are to be interrupted. Only interactions of these types are affected. If null, all types will be interrupted.<br />**(Note: An empty set will interrupt NO TYPES.)** |
| RequiredTag | `String` | **No** | An asset tag that, if provided, the RootInteraction of the interaction chain must have in order to be canceled. |
| ExcludedTag | `String` | **No** |  An asset tag that, if provided, the RootInteraction of the interaction chain must not have in order to be canceled. |

**InteractionTarget Values**
- `User` - The user of this interaction chain. The entity whose actions caused this interaction chain to be executed. This is usually the same as the Owner.
- `Owner` - The owner of this interaction chain. The entity upon whom this interaction chain is executing.
- `Target` - The entity target of this interaction chain, if any.  This value is mutable (and can therefore come from many places) but most commonly, it is an entity the User was targeting when this interaction chain began executing.

**InteractionType Values**
- `Primary`
- `Secondary`
- `Ability1`
- `Ability2`
- `Ability3`
- `Use`
- `Pick`
- `Pickup`
- `CollisionEnter`
- `CollisionLeave`
- `Collision`
- `EntityStatEffect`
- `SwapTo`
- `SwapFrom`
- `Death`
- `Wielding`
- `ProjectileSpawn`
- `ProjectilHit`
- `ProjectileMiss`
- `ProjectileBounce`
- `Held`
- `HeldOffhand`
- `Equipped`
- `Dodge`
- `GameModeSwap`


### Parallel

This interaction does not inherit from SimpleInteraction and therefore has no Next or Failed fields. 

This interaction has a field `Interactions` that is an array of RootInteraction assets. The list must contain at least 
  two RootInteractions.  This interaction will fork all of its children except for the first into their 
  own interaction chains and immediately complete. After this interaction completes, this interaction chain will 
  execute the first RootInteraction in the `Interactions` list.

This interaction does not have any failure conditions and is indifferent to the fate of the forked interaction chains.

**Parallel Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Interactions | `AssetArray`<br />(Element Type: `RootInteraction`) | **Yes** | An array of RootInteractions that will be forked or executed. |


### Repeat 

This interaction has a field `ForkInteractions` that is an asset of type RootInteraction. This interaction will fork that 
  RootInteraction into its own interaction chain and then wait for it to complete. If the RootInteraction fails, this 
  interaction will complete immediately and be marked failed. Otherwise, the RootInteraction will be forked and run again,
  up to a specified total number of times.

**Repeat Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| ForkInteractions | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `RootInteraction`) | **Yes** | A RootInteraction that will be forked. |
| Repeat | `Integer`<br />(Default: 1)<br />**Must be -1 or a positive integer. 0 is not valid.** | **No** | The total number of times to fork ForkInteractions. If -1 is provided, ForkInteractions will continue being forked and executed indefinitely, until this interaction is cancelled or until ForkInteractions fails. |


### Replace 

This interaction does not inherit from SimpleInteraction and therefore has no Next or Failed fields.

This interaction uses the InteractionVars system that is avaiable for items. InteractionVars are RootInteractions that 
  can be attached to an Item asset with a name.
  
This interaction specifies a var name, and if this interaction chain was executed through 
  an item and that item has an InteractionVar of the same name, then this interaction will immediately execute 
  the RootInteraction on the var.  Otherwise, it will execute the default RootInteraction specified in this interaction. 
  If no default is specified, then this interaction will be marked as failed.

**Replace Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Var | `String` | **Yes** | The name of the InteractionVar to execute. |
| DefaultValue | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `RootInteraction`) | **No** | The RootInteraction to execute if the owning item does not have an InteractionVar by the specified name. If not provided, the interaction will be marked as failed instead. |
| DefaultOk | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If false, then an angry message will be printed to the server logs if the owning item does not have an InteractionVar by the specified name.  The functioning of this interaction will be otherwise unaffected. |


### RunRootInteraction 

This interaction immediately executes the provided RootInteraction as part of this interaction chain. This interaction 
  does not have any failure conditions.

**RunRootInteraction Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| RootInteraction | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `RootInteraction`) | **Yes** | The RootInteraction to execute. |


### Serial 

This interaction does not inherit from SimpleInteraction and therefore has no Next or Failed fields.

This interaction has a field `Interactions` which is a list of Interaction assets. This interaction immediately 
  completes and the interaction chain continues by executing the interactions in the list one at a time. This 
  interaction does not have any failure conditions.

**Serial Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Interactions | `AssetArray`<br />(Element Type: `Interaction`) | **Yes** | An array of Interaction assets to execute. |


## Blocks

These are interaction types meant to reason about and modify blocks in the world.  The most important concept unique
 to these interactions is the Block Target.  Like the Entity Target, it is mutable and can come from many places. 
 However, for interaction chains initiated by the client, the block target will initially be the block that the player's cursor was 
 over, if any.

Additionally, for interaction chains initiated by the client, the client will send along which face of the block is targeted,
 which is used by a few block-related interactions.
 It is left up to each interaction type that cares about block faces as to how to handle this behavior for simulated input 
 (i.e. NPCs initiating chains that are normally initated by the client).  At the time of this writing, all block-related 
 interactions choose the top face where relevant in simulated input.

### BlockCondition 

This interaction has a field `Matchers` which specifies certain conditions, such as block type, state, etc.  This 
 interaction fails if the current target block does not match all of them.

**BlockCondition Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| UserLatestTarget | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, update this interaction chain's target block from the client's current cursor position before executing the interaction. |
| Matchers | `Array`<br />(Element Type: `BlockMatcher`) | **Yes** | A list of conditions that the target block must match or this condition will fail.<br />**Note: This field is technically not required but there is a bug that makes it dangerous to not provide at the time of this writing.**<br />**Note: If no conditions are added to this array, the interaction will fail, counterintuitively.** |

**BlockMatcher Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Block | `BlockIdMatcher` | **No** | If provided, requires the block itself match some set of conditions. |
| Face | `BlockFace` | **No** | If provided and not 'None', requires a specific block face be targeted. |
| StaticFace | `Boolean` (Default: false) | **No** | If false, the face condition will be adjusted by the block's current rotation. |

**BlockFace Values**
- `Up`
- `Down`
- `North`
- `South`
- `East`
- `West`
- `None`

**BlockIdMatcher Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------| 
| Id | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `BlockType`) | **No** | If provided, the block must match the specified `BlockType`. |
| State | `String` | **No** | If provided, the block's current state must match the provided state name. |
| Tag | `String` | **No** | If provided, the block type's asset tags must contain the provided tag. |


### DestroyCondition 

This interaction fails if the current User entity cannot destroy the current target blcok.

**DestroyCondition Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| UserLatestTarget | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, update this interaction chain's target block from the client's current cursor position before executing the interaction. |


### PlacementCountCondition

This interaction accepts the name of a BlockType that has the TrackedPlacement BlockEntity. The interaction will fail if the number of 
 blocks of the provided BlockType in the world do not match the provided condition.

**PlacementCountCondition Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Block | `String` | **Yes** | The BlockType to examine. The number of instances of the BlockType in the world will be compared to Value.<br />**Note: The specified BlockType must have the TrackedPlacement BlockEntity. Otherwise, the number of blocks in the world will always be zero.** |
| Value | `Integer`<br />(Default: 0) | **No** | The value to compare the number of blocks in the world with. |
| LessThan | `Boolean<br />(Default: true) | **No** | If true, the interaction will fail if the number of blocks in the world is greater than or equal to Value. If false, the interaction will fail if the number of blocks in the world is less than or equal to Value. |


### BreakBlock

This interaction attempts to break the target block while acting as the User entity. The User entity must be a player. It 
 is not guaranteed to work, depending on world settings and the User entity's current state, it may not work.  If it 
  fails, it will fail the interaction under some circumstances, but not others. 

**Note: In particular, if `Harvest`=false and the player is in Survival mode, the player will simply execute a damage operation 
 against the block. Even when the Tool field is specified, the player's currently-held item can impact the results in unintuitive 
 ways.**

This interaction will fail if there is no block target, if `Harvest`=true and the 
  block is not harvestable, or if the world settings prevent the Harvest/Break operation.
  It will generally not fail otherwise, even if the block was not broken or damaged.
  The block will generally break every time if `Harvest`=true or the player is in 
  Creative mode.


**BreakBlock Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| UserLatestTarget | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, update this interaction chain's target block from the client's current cursor position before executing the interaction. |
| Harvest | `Boolean` (Default: false) | **No** | If true, harvest the block and deposit the drops in the player's inventory. This operation will generally always succeed.  If false, this interaction will effectively perform whatever action would have occurred if the player had left-clicked the block. |
| Tool | `String` | **No** | If `Harvest`=true, the player is in Survival mode, and this field is provided, then the break operation will be performed as though with this tool type.<br />**This field mostly doesn't work.  Your held item will be used for most block damage calculations regardless of this field's contents.** |
| MatchTool | `Boolean` (Default: false) | **No** | If true, `Harvest`=true, the player is in Survival mode, and `Tool` is provided, block breaking will be prevented unless `Tool` is a valid gathering tool for the target block. The interaction will not be failed, even if block breaking is prevented in this manner. |


### ChangeBlock 

This interaction requires a mapping from one or more current BlockTypes to one or more target BlockTypes.  If the 
  target block is one of the key BlockTypes, then it will be changed to the mapped target BlockType.  If the current 
  BlockType of the target block does not appear as a key in the Changes field, then this interaction fails.

**ChangeBlock Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| UserLatestTarget | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, update this interaction chain's target block from the client's current cursor position before executing the interaction. |
| Changes | `Map`<br />(Key Type: `BlockType`, Value Type: `BlockType`) | **No** | A list of potential block type changes, with each entry having a current and new BlockType id. |
| WorldSoundEventId | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `SoundEvent`) | **No** | If provided, this SoundEvent is played in the world at the position of the block if the block successfully changes. |
| RequireNotBroken | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, this interaction will fail if the player's held item is broken (durability 0), and the block change will not take place. |


### ChangeState 

This interaction requires a mapping from one or more current block state names to one or more state names. If the 
  target block is in one of the key block states, then it will be changed to the mapped target blocks tate. If the 
  current block state of the target block does nto appear as a key in the Changes field, then this interaction fails.

All blocks start out with a null state by default.  This null state can be referenced by the key "default" and the block 
  can be returned to that state with the value "default".

**ChangeState Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| UserLatestTarget | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, update this interaction chain's target block from the client's current cursor position before executing the interaction. |
| Changes | `Map`<br />(Key Type: `String`, Value Type: `String`) | **No** | A list of potential block state changes, with each entry having a current and new state name. |
| UpdateBlockState | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, performs a full refresh of the block's BlockEntity component and notifies nearby players as though a full block type change occurred. |


### CycleBlockGroup

This interaction will attempt to change the target block to the next block type in one of the BlockGroups it belongs to.
  If the block type belongs to multiple BlockGroups, which one is used is effectively arbitrary. The User entity must be 
  a player. If the block cannot be changed for any reason (entity not a player, no block target, block does not belong 
  to a BlockGroup, etc.). If the block is the only entry in the BlockGroup, this interaction will succeed and the block 
  will be considered changed despite nothing happening.  Unlike most other block-changing interactions, this one will 
  fail if the world settings prevent players from breaking blocks.

**This interaction always reduces the player's held item's durability by a single 'hit' worth of damage if the block
  changes. There is no way to prevent it. The block type will change and the interaction will succeed even if the player's
  held item is broken, however.**

**CycleBlockGroup Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| UserLatestTarget | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, update this interaction chain's target block from the client's current cursor position before executing the interaction. |


### DestroyBlock

This interaction destroys the target block without dropping anything.  It will successfully destroy the block if the 
  target block exists and this interaction has no failure conditions. 
  
**This interaction has no additional fields.**


### PickBlock

This interaction is effectively equivalent to using the middle mouse button in creative mode. In survival mode, the
  block's item will be moved to the user's current active hotbar slot if it is in the player's inventory.  This 
  interaction is performed entirely on the client and cannot be performed by non-players.  It is unclear if this 
  interaction has failure conditions.

**PickBlock Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| UserLatestTarget | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, update this interaction chain's target block from the client's current cursor position before executing the interaction. |


### PlaceBlock

This interaction is effectively identical to a right clicking while holding a block in their hand, with some 
  additional options. For one, it can be executed with any LivingEntity as the User entity. For another, it has some 
  useful fields.  For the most part, though, it follows the same behaviors and rules as any ordinary block placement 
  by a player.

It's not clear under what circumstances this interaction can fail. The server will not fail the interaction under any 
  special circumstances (including when there is no target block, or when `BlockTypeToPlace` is not provided and the 
  LivingEntity is not holding a block). However, the client is very involved with the function of this interaction and 
  its behavior is unknown.

**PlaceBlock Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| BlockTypeToPlace | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `BlockType`) | **No** | If provided, the block placed by this interaction will be the specified BlockType. If not provided, the User entity's held item will be used, instead, if it is a block. |
| RemoveItemInHand | `Boolean`<br />(Default: True) | **No** | If true and the User entity is not a player in Creative mode, the item in the player's hand must match the block being placed and one quantity will be removed for each block placed. If the item does not match, the block cannot be placed.  If false, the player's hand item is ignored entirely.** |
| AllowDragPlacement | `Boolean`<br />(Default: True) | **No** | If true and the interaction was triggered on the client by a player, then the player can hold the input that was used to activate this interaction chain and move the mouse around in order to execute this interaction repeatedly and place several blocks. The interaction chain will not move onto the next interaction until the player releases the input. |


## Items 

These are interactions intended to interface with an entity's inventory. There is no concept of an "item target", 
  unfortunately, so these generally either interact with the entity's held item or the entity's inventory at a high level.

### AddItem 

Adds a specified quantity of a specified item to the User entity's inventory, preferring to add it to the 
 entity's hotbar where possible. This interaction will have no effect on User entities that are not LivingEntities.
 This interaction has no failure states.

**Note: This interaction has a bug in its field validators that will cause interactions that reference items declared 
  in the same mod to fail validation on startup.  Additionally, this interaction has a bug that will cause it to
  fail and have no effect if the User entity has no block target. Use ModifyInventory instead.**

**AddItem Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| UserLatestTarget | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, update this interaction chain's target block from the client's current cursor position before executing the interaction. |
| ItemId | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `Item`) | **Yes** | The item id of the item to add to the player's inventory. |
| Quantity | `Integer`<br />(Default: 0) | **No** | The quantity of the item to add to the player's inventory. |


### PickupItem

This interaction will attempt to pick up the User entity's current target entity and add it to their inventory. It will 
  fail if the User entity is not a player, if they do not have a target entity, or if the target entity is not an item 
  located in the world.  It will not fail if the player simply cannot pick up the item.  
  
**This interaction has no additional fields.**


### ModifyInventory

This interaction attempts to perform one or more inventory-modifying actions against the User entity. The User entity must 
  be a player. If they are not, no actions will be performed, but the interaction will not fail. Any item removals performed 
  by this interaction, either as a result of `ItemToRemove` or `AdjustHeldItemQuantity`, are both atomic (meaning the entire
  quantity must be removed, or none) and required (meaning that the interaction will fail and no further actions taken if
  the removal fails for any reason).  Item additions performed by this interaction, either as a result of `ItemToAdd` or
  `AdjustHeldItemQuantity` will drop excess items on the ground near the player if necesary and continue on. 

This interaction first executes the item removal in `ItemToRemove`, if any, then adjusts the held item as specified by 
  `AdjustHeldItemQuantity`, if provided, then executes the item addition in `ItemToAdd`, if any, and then finally executes 
  the damage/healing of the held item in `AdjustHeldItemDurability`, if provided.
  
**ModifyDurability Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| RequiredGameMode | `GameMode` | **No** | If provided, only execute the inventory-modifying actions if the player is in the provided GameMode. The interaction will not fail if the GameMode doesn't match. |
| ItemToRemove | `ItemStack` | **No** | If provided, a matching item will be removed in the provided quantity. If there is no matching item in the player inventory in the required quantity, then the interaction will fail and further actions will not be executed. |
| AdjustHeldItemQuantity | `Integer`<br />(Default: 0) | **No** | The player's held item, if any, will have its quantity will be modified by the provided amount- subtracted from if this number is negative or added to if this item is positive.  If the player has no held item, then this field will have no effect regardless of its value and the interaction will NOT fail.  If the player's inventory does not have sufficient quantity of items to support the removal, this interaction will fail and further actions will not be executed. Excess items will be dropped on the ground near the player. |
| ItemToAdd | `ItemStack` | **No** | If provided, the ItemStack will be added to the player's inventory. Excess items will be dropped on the ground near the player. |
| AdjustHeldItemDurability | `Double`<br />(Default: 0.0) | **No** | The player's held item, if any, will have its durability adjusted by the specified amount.  The durability cannot go below 0 or raise above the item's maximum durability. Invalid durability values in this field will not cause the interaction to fail. Neither will it fail if the player has no held item. |
| BrokenItem | `String` | **No** | This field should contain an ItemId, but it is not validated by the server on startup, so be careful.  This field can have the value of "Empty" to specify no item, or an empty hand. If specified and the `AdjustHeldItemDurability` operation reduces the player's held item to 0 durability, the player's held item is changed to this ItemId. If the inventory replacement fails, this interaction will fail. |
| NotifyOnBreak | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true and the `AdjustHeldItemDurability` operation reduces the player's held item to 0 durability, this interaction will perform the usual audiovisual feedback of a broken tool. It will play the usual tool breaking sound and send the player a text message in chat that their item has broken. |
| NotifyOnBreakMessage | `String` | **No** | If provided, and `NotifyOnBreak` is true, when the player is notified of a broken tool by this interaction, the message sent to their chat will instead be the translation key specified by this field. The translation key supports the templating parameter `{itemName}`. See the translation key `server.general.repair.itemBroken_Hoe` for an example. |

**GameMode Values**
- `Creative`: The game is currently in Creative Mode 
- `Adventure`: The game is currently in Adventure Mode 

**ItemStack Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Id | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `Item`) | **Yes** | The id of the Item asset this stack contains. |
| Quantity | `Integer`<br />(Default: 1) | **No** | The number of items in this stack.<br />**Must be greater than 0.** |
| Durability | `Double`<br />(Default: 0.0) | **No** | The durability of the item stack.<br />**Cannot be negative.** |
| MaxDurability | `Double`<br />(Default: 0.0) | **No** | The maximum durability of the item this stack contains.<br />**Cannot be negative.** |

| OverrideDroppedItemAnimation | `Boolean`*(Default: false) | **No** | ??? |


## EntityEffects

EntityEffects are buff or debuff effects that can be applied to a LivingEntity.  These can have a variety of effects from
  movement speed changes to periodic damage.

### EffectCondition 

This interaction will fail if the specified entity's EntityEffects do not match the provided conditions. 

**EffectCondition Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Entity | `InteractionTarget`<br />(Default: User) | **Yes** | The entity to examine for EntityEffects. This field can indicate the Owner, User, or Target of this interaction chain. |
| Match | `Match`<br />(Default: All) | **No** | If `All`, then this interaction will fail if any EntityEffect in the `EntityEffectIds` is not on the specified entity. If `None`, then this interaction will fail if any EntityEffect IS on the specified entity. |
| EntityEffectIds | `AssetArray`<br />(Element Type: `EntityEffect`) | **Yes** | The set of EntityEffects to check against the specified entity and `Match`. |

**InteractionTarget Values**
- `User` - The user of this interaction chain. The entity whose actions caused this interaction chain to be executed. This is usually the same as the Owner.
- `Owner` - The owner of this interaction chain. The entity upon whom this interaction chain is executing.
- `Target` - The entity target of this interaction chain, if any.  This value is mutable (and can therefore come from many places) but most commonly, it is an entity the User was targeting when this interaction chain began executing.

**Match Values**
- `All` - All EntityEffects must be on the specified entity for this interaction to succeed. 
- `None` - None of the EntityEffects must be on the specified entity for this interaction to succeed.


### ApplyEffect 

This interaction will apply the specified EntityEffect to the specified Entity.  It has no special failure conditions. 

**ApplyEffect Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Entity | `InteractionTarget`<br />(Default: User) | **Yes** | The entity to apply the EntityEffect to. This field can indicate the Owner, User, or Target of this interaction chain. |
| EffectId | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `EntityEffect`) | **Yes** | The effect to apply. |

**InteractionTarget Values**
- `User` - The user of this interaction chain. The entity whose actions caused this interaction chain to be executed. This is usually the same as the Owner.
- `Owner` - The owner of this interaction chain. The entity upon whom this interaction chain is executing.
- `Target` - The entity target of this interaction chain, if any.  This value is mutable (and can therefore come from many places) but most commonly, it is an entity the User was targeting when this interaction chain began executing.


### ClearEntityEffect

This interaction will remove the specified EntityEffect from the specified Entity. It has no special failure conditions. 
  It will not fail if the Entity does not have the EntityEffect. 

**ClearEntityEffect Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Entity | `InteractionTarget`<br />(Default: User) | **Yes** | The entity to remove the EntityEffect from. This field can indicate the Owner, User, or Target of this interaction chain. |
| EffectId | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `EntityEffect`) | **Yes** | The effect to remove. |

**InteractionTarget Values**
- `User` - The user of this interaction chain. The entity whose actions caused this interaction chain to be executed. This is usually the same as the Owner.
- `Owner` - The owner of this interaction chain. The entity upon whom this interaction chain is executing.
- `Target` - The entity target of this interaction chain, if any.  This value is mutable (and can therefore come from many places) but most commonly, it is an entity the User was targeting when this interaction chain began executing.


## Cooldowns 

RootInteractions interface with a complex cooldown system that can be used for a variety of purposes. Aside from simply 
  adding an important aspect of resource management to your game design, cooldowns can be used to ensure that click-activated 
  interaction chains don't repeatedly spam if the player holds down the input. 

By default, every RootInteraction has a cooldown timer that is keyed to the RootInteraction name, and by default, it 
  will launch a cooldown of 0.35 seconds when activated by client input.  Otherwise, no cooldown will be activated.  However,
  by configuring your RootInteraction, you can change the key for the cooldown (so that multiple RootInteractions can share 
  a single cooldown), set the cooldown timer to whatever you like, and configure multiple charges that can build up over time
  to allow the entity to activate the RootInteraction multiple times before encountering a cooldown timer. 

One important concept to keep in mind is the difference between **cooldown** and **charge time**.  The cooldown, if any,
  is activated each time a RootInteraction triggers, even if the player has more available charges. If the RootInteraction 
  is configured to use charges, then they will gradually build up over time. In order for a RootInteraction to be activated,
  the cooldown (if any) must be expired, and the RootInteraction must have at least one charge (if the ability has been 
  configured to use charges). 

Bear in mind that the entire Cooldown configuration is shared between different RootInteractions with the same cooldown id.
  If you use an ability with 5 charges and a short cooldown and then another ability with a much longer cooldown and no 
  charges, the second ability will use the cooldown properties of the first ability until/unless the first ability finishes 
  charging and is cleared from the system.  You should generally only have multiple RootInteractions share a cooldown id 
  if they have the same configuration.

The interactions below interact with the cooldown system to allow you to manipulate cooldowns via the interaction system.

### CooldownCondition

**CooldownCondition Fields**

This interaction will fail if the specified cooldown id is on cooldown for the User entity.  This interaction will only 
  function for players- the interaction will always succeed for NPCs.  In order for this interaction to succeed, the 
  cooldown, if any, must have expired and at least one charge, if any, must have filled.

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Id | `String` | **Yes** | The cooldown id to check. |

### IncrementCooldown

**IncrementCooldown Fields**

This interaction will modify a cooldown that is currently active on the User entity, allowing charges and remaining 
  cooldown to be modified.
  Despite its name, this interaction can be used to reduce a cooldown as well as increase it. If the cooldown is not 
  currently active, this interaction will have no effect. The interaction has no special failure conditions. 

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Id | `String` | **No** | If provided, the cooldown id of the cooldown to be manipulated. If not provided, the cooldown id of the current chain's RootInteraction will be used. |
| Time | `Float`<br />(Default: 0.0) | **No** | The amount to increase the remaining cooldown by. Can be negative. The remaining cooldown time will not be reduced below zero or increased above the maximum cooldown time. |
| ChargeTime | `Float`<br />(Default: 0.0) | **No** | The amount to increase the remaining time until the next charge is filled by. Can be negative. The remaining charge time cannot be reduced below zero or increased above the maximum cooldown time. **This will not work on abilities that have a maximum of 1 charge, for some reason.** |
| Charge | `Integer`<br />(Default: 0) | **No** | The amount to increase the number of charges by. Can be negative. The number of charges cannot be reduced below 0 or increased above the maximum. |
| InterruptRecharge | `Boolean`(Default: false) | **No** | If true and `Charge` is not 0, will reset the remaining time to the next charge to the maximum value after changing the charge count. |

### ResetCooldown

This interaction will trigger a cooldown on the User entity with a specified configuration. The charges will be refilled 
  but the cooldown will be immediately triggered.  The mechanisms for deciding on the configuration are a little bit complicated.
  You may specify a cooldown configuration via the `Cooldown` field. If you do not include an `Id` field, then the 
  interaction chain's RootInteraction will be used for any field not specified in the configuration. If there is an active 
  cooldown under the specified `Id` (or under the RootInteraction's cooldown id if none is specified) then the fields 
  from that active cooldown will overwrite data in the RootInteraction's cooldown, but not data in your `Cooldown` field.

**ResetCooldown Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Cooldown | `InteractionCooldown` | **No** | A cooldown configuration to use for the new, reset cooldown. |

**InteractionCooldown Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Id | `String` | **No** | The cooldown id to use for this cooldown. If not provided, the RootInteraction's cooldown id will be used, if any. |
| Cooldown | `Float`<br />(Default: 0.0) | **No** | The duration of the cooldown, in seconds. | 
| Charges | `Array`<br />(Element Type: `Float`) | **No** | If provided, a list of how many charges this cooldown can build, and how long each charge takes to build, in seconds. |
| InterruptRecharge | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, the charge time will be reset when the number of charges changes. |
| ClickBypass | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, RootInteractions keyed to this cooldown can still be activated when it is on cooldown provided that the RootInteraction was triggered by a distinct key or mouse button press on the client. |
