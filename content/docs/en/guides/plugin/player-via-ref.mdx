## Overview

In Haytale, there are two different types of player objects: the pure player object and the reference object.

### PlayerRef
Represents the server-side session of a player.
Holds identity (UUID, username), network connection, language, chunk tracking, and communication.
Exists even when the player is not currently in a world.

### Player
Represents the in-game entity of the player.
Contains gameplay logic such as movement, physics, inventory, game mode, interactions, and damage.
Exists only while the player is spawned in a world.

## Get Player Object

Here is a small code snippet to retrieve the player object when the player is online.

```java
    /**
     * Retrieves the player instance associated with the given player reference.
     *
     * @param playerRef the reference object representing the player
     * @return the Player instance corresponding to the provided player reference
     */
    public static Player getPlayerByRef(PlayerRef playerRef) {
        // Get Entity Stores.
        Ref<EntityStore> targetRef = playerRef.getReference();

        // Get Target Store.
        Store<EntityStore> targetStore = targetRef.getStore();

        // Get Target Player Component.
        return  (Player) targetStore.getComponent(targetRef, Player.getComponentType());
    }
```
