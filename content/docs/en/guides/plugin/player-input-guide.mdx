## The Basics

Hytale Servers **do not receive raw keyboard input.** Instead, clients send `packets` of Interaction types:
- **Mouse events** - clicks with target info
- **Movement states** - 22 boolean flags (walking, jumping, etc.)
- **Interaction types** - what action the player is performing

---

## Keybind Limitations
Due to the use of `packets` not key inputs, you cannot assign your custom Fireball spell to X. 

**You CANNOT:**
- Add new keybinds (keyboard mapping is client-side)
- Remap existing keys
- Add more than 3 ability slots

**You CAN:**
- Intercept `packets` and hijack their purpose
- Use 3 built-in ability slots (`Ability1`, `Ability2`, `Ability3`)
- Make abilities item-dependent (wand = fireball, sword = slash)
- Detect hold vs tap, double-click, toggle (via timing)
- Full mouse control (all 5 buttons, press/release, drag)

### Fixed Input Slots

| Action | Default Key | Server Receives | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| Left Mouse | LMB | `InteractionType.Primary` | Attack/break |
| Right Mouse | RMB | `InteractionType.Secondary` | Use/place |
| Weapon Ability | Q | `InteractionType.Ability1` | Active - weapon special |
| Ability Slot 2 | E | `InteractionType.Ability2` | Unused placeholder |
| Ability Slot 3 | R | `InteractionType.Ability3` | Unused placeholder |
| Interact | F | `InteractionType.Use` | Interact with world |
| Pick Block | MMB | `InteractionType.Pick` | Copy block type |
| Dodge | LCTRL | `InteractionType.Dodge` | Dodge roll mechanic |

**Note:** Only `Ability1` (Q key) is actively used for weapon abilities. `Ability2` and `Ability3` exist in the enum but nothing in the codebase references them: they appear to be reserved for future use.

These are the only keyboard actions the server sees.

## Intercepting Packets

There is potential for a workaround where packets are intercepted from the client and redirected to your own custom class files. However, this is still under active testing. As it stands, all previous attempts have ran into roadblocks.
- The Client enacts a lot of hard restrictions: Builder menu is a client UI, builder tools have a client-side gamemode check, etc
This guide will be actively updated as discovers as made.

There is also a possibility this is one of the categories Hypixel plans to expand API access on in the future, as a lot of what appears to be live CTS packet handling is stubbed from presumably an old system. Further findings will be shared as they are made.

## Mouse Inputs

Some useful info about mouse inputs

### Listening to Mouse Clicks

```java
@Override
protected void setup() {
    getEventRegistry().register(PlayerMouseButtonEvent.class, event -> {
        MouseButtonEvent mouse = event.getMouseButton();

        if (mouse.mouseButtonType == MouseButtonType.Left
                && mouse.state == MouseButtonState.Pressed) {
            // Left click!
            Entity target = event.getTargetEntity();
            Vector3i block = event.getTargetBlock();
        }

        // Cancel the click
        // event.setCancelled(true);
    });
}
```

---

### Mouse Button Types

```java
MouseButtonType.Left    // Primary click
MouseButtonType.Right   // Secondary click
MouseButtonType.Middle  // Scroll wheel click
MouseButtonType.X1      // Side button 1
MouseButtonType.X2      // Side button 2
```

```java
MouseButtonState.Pressed   // Button down
MouseButtonState.Released  // Button up
```

---

### What You Get From Mouse Events

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `getMouseButton()` | MouseButtonEvent | Button type, state, click count |
| `getTargetEntity()` | Entity | Entity under cursor (or null) |
| `getTargetBlock()` | Vector3i | Block position under cursor |
| `getItemInHand()` | Item | Currently held item |
| `getScreenPoint()` | Vector2f | Cursor screen position |
| `getPlayer()` | Player | The player who clicked |

**Double-click detection:**
```java
if (mouse.clicks >= 2) {
    // Double-clicked!
}
```

### Imports

```java
import com.hypixel.hytale.protocol.MouseButtonType;
import com.hypixel.hytale.protocol.MouseButtonState;
import com.hypixel.hytale.protocol.MouseButtonEvent;
import com.hypixel.hytale.protocol.InteractionType;
import com.hypixel.hytale.server.core.event.events.player.PlayerMouseButtonEvent;
import com.hypixel.hytale.server.core.event.events.player.PlayerMouseMotionEvent;
```

### Available Player Events

All player events that can be registered via `getEventRegistry()`:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `PlayerConnectEvent` | Player connecting to server |
| `PlayerDisconnectEvent` | Player disconnecting |
| `PlayerSetupConnectEvent` | Connection setup phase |
| `PlayerSetupDisconnectEvent` | Disconnect setup phase |
| `PlayerReadyEvent` | Player fully loaded and ready |
| `PlayerChatEvent` | Chat message sent |
| `PlayerInteractEvent` | Interaction with world/entities |
| `PlayerMouseButtonEvent` | Mouse button press/release |
| `PlayerMouseMotionEvent` | Mouse movement |
| `PlayerCraftEvent` | Item crafted |
| `AddPlayerToWorldEvent` | Player added to a world |
| `DrainPlayerFromWorldEvent` | Player removed from world |

---

## Tips

- **1 ability slot active**: Only `Ability1` (Q) is currently used - make it item-dependent
- **Cancel events**: Use `event.setCancelled(true)` to block the action
- **Movement states**: Check these in systems for continuous monitoring
- **Double-click**: Check `mouse.clicks >= 2`
- **Hold vs tap**: Track press/release timing yourself
- **Target info**: Events include what block/entity the player was targeting
- **No move event**: Poll `TransformComponent` or check `MovementStates` instead
