#### Source and Destination Material Explained

If you're trying to place bricks in water, then bricks are the Source Material, and water is the Destination Material.

* Source Material: the Material we're trying to place.
* Destination Material: the Material that exists where we want to place the Source Material.

#### DontPlace

If a Source Material is in the DontPlace BlockSet, it will not be placed.

#### DontReplace

By default, Source Materials cannot replace Destination Materials in this BlockSet. This rule is overridden by the Advanced rules below.

#### Advanced

The Advanced rules override the rules above for specific BlockSets.

Each rule has:

* A Source BlockSet that identifies which Source Materials the rule applies to.
* A CanReplace BlockSet that determines which Destination Materials those sources can replace.
