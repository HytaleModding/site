The World Structure asset defines how every aspect of a world is generated. Below are all entries for this asset.

### DefaultBiome

* Type: String
* Safe value: `"Basic"`

This Biome is used everywhere outside the delimiters.

### Density

* Type: Density slot
*   Safe value:

    ```json
    "Type": "Constant",
    "Value": 1
    ```

Determines the Biome distribution in the world. The values are interpreted by the `Biomes` delimiter list.

### Biomes

* Type: list of Biome delimiters
* Safe value: `[]`

Each delimiter assigns a Biome to places in the world where the Density is within its bounds.

### DefaultTransitionDistance

* Type: integer
* Safe value: `32`

The distance, in blocks, it takes for one Biome to transition into another. The terrain in that region is interpolated between the two Biomes. Larger distances impact performance.

### MaxBiomeEdgeDistance

* Type: integer
* Safe value: `0`

The maximum distance from any Biome edge that world-gen tracks. This impacts Biomes that use the DistanceFromBiomeEdge Density node. Distances greater than this are read as `-1`.

### SpawnPositions

* Type: PositionProvider slot
*   Safe value:

    ```json
    "Type": "List",
    "Positions": [{"X": 0, "Y": 140, "Z": 0}]
    ```

The world's spawn positions.

### Framework

* Type: list of Framework modules
* Safe value: `[]`

The Framework helps define the world's high-level structure. It ensures consistency across multiple Biomes. For this to work, the Biomes in a World Structure must correctly interpret the Framework entries.

```json
// Example of a DecimalConstants Framework entry.
"Framework": [
  {
    "Type": "DecimalConstants",
    "Entries": [
      {
        "Name": "Base",
        "Value": 100
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Below are the types of Framework entries.

#### Positions

A list of named Positions fields for the world.

* Entries: list of entries
  * Name: string. The name to use when referencing this entry from inside the Biomes.
  * Positions: PositionProvider slot.

#### DecimalConstants

A list of named decimal constants.

* Name: string. The constant's name.
* Value: decimal number.
